# Maintainers

This file contains a list of the maintainers of the tldr-pages project.
Note: only the people marked with **bold** are currently in the indicated role.
The other entries are kept for historical record.

There are three types of maintainers, as described in
[COMMUNITY-ROLES.md](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/master/COMMUNITY-ROLES.md#when-to-change-roles):
repository collaborators, organization members, and organization owners
— each having specific roles in maintaining the project, as outlined below.

In general terms, all maintainers are expected to follow the
[Maintainer's guide](contributing-guides/maintainers-guide.md).


## Repository collaborators

Repository collaborators have write access to this repository,
which allows them to label, edit and close issues,
as well as review and merge pull requests from other contributors.
If you are an owner of the organization, you should be able to see an automated list
