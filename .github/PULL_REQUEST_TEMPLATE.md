Thank you for contributing!
Please fill in the following checklist, removing items that do not apply.
See also https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md.

NOTE: We strongly discourage using generative AI tools to create new pages,
as their output is often inaccurate and may not follow our style guidelines. 
Machine translation tools may be used for reference, but their results must be thoroughly 
proofread before submission. Any pull request suspected of being generated entirely by 
AI or machine translation will be closed.
