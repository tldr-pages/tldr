- Fake the time to this evening, before printing the result of `date`:

`faketime '{{today 23:30}}' {{date}}`

- Open a new `bash` shell, which uses yesterday as the current date:

`faketime '{{yesterday}}' {{bash}}`

- Simulate how a program would act next Friday night:

`faketime '{{next Friday 1 am}}' {{path/to/program}}`
