# service

> Manage services by running init scripts.
> The full script path should be omitted (`/etc/init.d/` is assumed).

- List the name and status of all services:

`service --status-all`

- Start/Stop/Restart/Reload service (start/stop should always be available):

`service {{service_name}} {{start|stop|restart|reload}}`

- Do a full restart (runs script twice with start and stop):

`service {{service_name}} --full-restart`

- Show the current status of a service:

`service {{service_name}} status`
