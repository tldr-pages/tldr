# abroot

> ABRoot utility provides full immutability and atomicity by transacting between 2 root partition states (AâŸºB).
> It also allows on-demand transactions via a transactional shell.
> More information: <https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/ABRoot>.

- Output the current or future root partition state:

`sudo abroot get {{present|future}}`

- Enter the transactional shell in the future root partition and switch root on the next boot:

`sudo abroot shell`

- Execute a specific command in the transactional shell in the future root partition and switch to it on the next boot:

`sudo abroot exec "{{command}}"`

- Install specific packages in the host inside the transactional shell in the future root partition and switch to it on the next boot:

`sudo abroot exec apt install {{package1 package2 ...}}`

- Update the boot partition (for advanced users only):

`sudo abroot _update-boot`
