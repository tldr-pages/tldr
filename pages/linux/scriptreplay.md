# scriptreplay

> Replay a typescript created by the `script` command to the standard output.

- Replay a typescript at the speed it was recorded:

`scriptreplay {{path/to/timing_file}} {{path/to/typescript}}`

- Replay a typescript at double the original speed:

`scriptreplay {{path/to/timingfile}} {{path/to/typescript}} 2`

- Replay a typescript at half the original speed:

`scriptreplay {{path/to/timingfile}} {{path/to/typescript}} 0.5`
