> Reserve a device for PipeWire.
> More information: <https://docs.pipewire.org/page_man_pw-reserve_1.html>.

- Reserve a device (currently only supports audio devices):

`pw-reserve {{[-n|--name]}} {{audioN}}`

- Monitor a device instead of reserving it:

`pw-reserve {{[-n|--name]}} {{audioN}} {{[-m|--monitor]}}`
