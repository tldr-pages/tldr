- Ping a host, specifying the interval in seconds between requests (default is 1 second):

`ping -i {{seconds}} "{{host}}"`

- Ping a host without trying to lookup symbolic names for addresses:

`ping -n "{{host}}"`

- Ping a host and ring the bell when a packet is received (if your terminal supports it):

`ping -a "{{host}}"`

- Ping a host and prints the time a packet was received (this option is an Apple addition):

`ping --apple-time "{{host}}"`
