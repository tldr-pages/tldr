- Add a route to a destination through a gateway:

`sudo route add "{{destination_ip_address}}" "{{gateway_address}}"`

- Add a route to a /24 subnet through a gateway:

`sudo route add "{{subnet_ip_address}}/24" "{{gateway_address}}"`

- Run in test mode (does not do anything, just print):

`sudo route -t add "{{destination_ip_address}}/24" "{{gateway_address}}"`

- Remove all routes:

`sudo route flush`

- Delete a specific route:

`sudo route delete "{{destination_ip_address}}/24"`

- Lookup and display the route for a destination (hostname or IP address):

`sudo route get "{{destination}}"`
