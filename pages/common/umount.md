# umount

> Revokes access to an entire filesystem mounted to a directory.
> A filesystem cannot be unmounted when it is busy.

- Unmount a filesystem:

    umount {{path_to_device_file}}

- OR:

    umount {{path_to_mounted_directory}}

- Unmount all mounted filesystems (dangerous!):

    umount -a
