# rename

> Renames multiple files.

- Rename files using a Perl Common Regular Expression (substitute 'foo' with 'bar' wherever found):

    rename {{'s/foo/bar/'}} {{\*}}

- Dry-run - display which renames would occur without performing them:

    rename -n {{'s/foo/bar/'}} {{\*}}

- Convert filenames to lower case:

    rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' {{\*}}

- Replace whitespace with underscores:

    rename 's/\s+/_/g' {{\*}}
