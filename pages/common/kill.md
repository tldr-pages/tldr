# kill

> Sends a signal to a process, usually related to stopping the process.
> All signals except for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can be intercepted by the process to perform a clean exit.

- Terminate a program using the default SIGTERM (terminate) signal:

`kill {{process_id}}`

- List available signal names (to be used without the `SIG` prefix):

`kill -l`

- Terminate a program using the SIGHUP (hang up) signal. Many daemons will reload instead of terminating:

`kill -{{1|HUP}} {{process_id}}`

- Terminate a program using the SIGINT (interrupt) signal. This is typically initiated by the user pressing `Ctrl + C`:

`kill -{{2|INT}} {{process_id}}`

- Signal the operating system to immediately terminate a program (which gets no chance to capture the signal):

`kill -{{9|KILL}} {{process_id}}`

- Signal the operating system to pause a program, it until a SIGCONT ("continue") signal is received:

`kill -{{17|STOP}} {{process_id}}`
