# git bug

> A distributed bug tracker that uses git's internal storage, so no files are added in your project.
> You may submit your problems to the same git remote you use to interact with others, much like commits and branches.
> More information: <https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/doc/md/git-bug.md>.
