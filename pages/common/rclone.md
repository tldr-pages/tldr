# rclone

> Copy, synchronize or move files and directories to and from many cloud services.
> More information: <https://rclone.org>.

- Launch an interactive menu to setup rclone:

`rclone config`

- List contents of a directory on an rclone remote:

`rclone lsf {{remote_name}}:{{path/to/directory}}`

- Copy a file or directory from the local machine to the remote destination:

`rclone copy {{path/to/source_file_or_directory}} {{remote_name}}:{{path/to/directory}}`

- Copy files changed within the past 24 hours to a remote from the local machine, asking the user to confirm each file:

`rclone copy --interactive --max-age 24h {{remote_name}}:{{path/to/directory}} {{path/to/local_directory}} `

- Mirror a specific file or directory (Note: Unlike copy, sync removes files from the remote if it does not exist locally):

`rclone sync {{path/to/file_or_directory}} {{remote_name}}:{{path/to/directory}}`

- Delete a remote file or directory (Note: `--dry-run` means test, remove it from the command to actually delete):

`rclone --dry-run delete {{remote_name}}:{{path/to/file_or_directory}}`

- Mount rclone remote (experimental):

`rclone mount {{remote_name}}:{{path/to/directory}} {{path/to/mount_point}}`

- Unmount rclone remote if CTRL-C fails (experimental):

`fusermount -u {{path/to/mount_point}}`
