# cp

> Copy files

- Copy files in arbitrary locations

`cp {{source}} {{target}}`

- Copy a file to a parent directory

`cp {{source}} ../{{target}}`

- Copy directories recursive using the option -r.

`cp -r {{source}} {{target}}`

- Copy files in verbose mode, showing files as they are copied. (Mostly interesting with -r option).

`cp -vr {{source}} {{target}}`
