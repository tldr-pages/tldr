# yadm-enter

> Run a sub-shell with all Git variables set.
> This sub-shell can be used to easily interact with your yadm repository **using "git" commands**.
> This  could be useful if you are using a tool which uses Git directly.
> More information: <https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/blob/master/yadm.md#commands>.

- To execute:

- You can exit the sub-shell the same way you leave your normal shell **usually with the "exit" command**:
