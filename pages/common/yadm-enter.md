# yadm-enter

> Run a sub-shell with all Git variables set.
> This sub-shell can be used to easily interact with your yadm repository **using "git" commands**.
> This  could be useful if you are using a tool which uses Git directly, such as tig, vim-fugitive, git-cola, etc.

- To execute:

`yadm enter`

- You can exit the sub-shell the same way you leave your normal shell **usually with the "exit" command**:

`exit`
