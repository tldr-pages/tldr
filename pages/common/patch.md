`patch < {{patch.diff}}`

- Apply a patch to a specific file:

`patch < {{patch.diff}} {{path/to/file}}`

- Patch a file writing the result to a different file:

`patch < {{patch.diff}} {{path/to/input_file}} {{[-o|--output]}} {{path/to/output_file}}`

- Apply a patch to the current directory:

`patch < {{patch.diff}} {{[-p|--strip]}} 1`

- Apply the reverse of a patch:

`patch < {{patch.diff}} {{[-R|--reverse]}}`
