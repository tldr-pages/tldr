- First import feed URLs from an OPML file:

`newsboat -i {{my-feeds.xml}}`

- Alternatively, add feeds manually:

`echo {{http://example.com/path/to/feed}} >> "${HOME}/.newsboat/urls"`

- Start newsboat and refresh all feeds on startup:

`newsboat -r`

- See keyboard shortcuts (the most relevant are visible in the status line):

`?`
