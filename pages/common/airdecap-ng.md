- Remove wireless headers from an open network capture file and use the access point's MAC address to filter:

`airdecap-ng -b {{ap_mac}} {{path/to/capture.cap}}`

- Decrypt a WEP encrypted capture file using the key in hex format:

`airdecap-ng -w {{hex_key}} {{path/to/capture.cap}}`

- Decrypt a WPA/WPA2 encrypted capture file using the access point's [e]ssid and [p]assword:

`airdecap-ng -e {{essid}} -p {{password}} {{path/to/capture.cap}}`

- Decrypt a WPA/WPA2 encrypted capture file preserving the headers using the access point's [e]ssid and [p]assword:

`airdecap-ng -l -e {{essid}} -p {{password}} {{path/to/capture.cap}}`

- Decrypt a WPA/WPA2 encrypted capture file using the access point's [e]ssid and [p]assword and use its MAC address to filter:

`airdecap-ng -b {{ap_mac}} -e {{essid}} -p {{password}} {{path/to/capture.cap}}`
