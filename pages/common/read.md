# read

> BASH builtin for retrieving data from standard input.

- Store data that you type from the keyboard:

`read {{variable}}`

- Store each of the next lines you enter as values of an array:

`read -a {{array}}`

- Specify the number of maximum characters to be read:

`read -n {{character_count}} {{variable}}`

- Use a specific character as a delimiter instead of a new line:

`read -d {{new_delimiter}} {{variable}}`

- Do not let backslash (\) act as an escape character:

`read -r {{variable}}`

- Display a prompt before the input:

`read -p "{{Enter your input here: }}" {{variable}}`

- Do not echo typed characters (silent mode):

`read -s {{variable}}`

- Read stdin and perform an action on every line:

`while read line; do echo "$line"; done`
