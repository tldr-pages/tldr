# git format-patch

> Prepare .patch files. Useful when emailing commits elsewhere.
> See also `git am`, which can apply generated .patch files.

- Create an auto-named .patch file for all the unpushed commits:

`git format-patch {{origin}}`

- Write a .patch file for all the commits between 2 revisions to stdout:

`git format-patch {{revision_1}}..{{revision_2}}`

- Write a .patch file for the 3 latest commits:

`git format-patch -{{3}}`
