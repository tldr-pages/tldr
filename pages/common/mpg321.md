# mpg321

> High Performance MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 Audio Player for Layer 1, 2, and 3.
> Mpg321 was written (sometime in 1999) to be a drop-in replacement for the (previously) non-free mpg123 player.

- Play an audio source exactly N times (N=0 means forever):

`mpg321 -l {{N}} {{path/to/file_a|URL}} {{path/to/file_b|URL}} {{...}}`

- Play a directory recursively:

`mpg321 -B {{path/to/directory}}`

- Enable Basic Keys ( `*` or `/` - Increase or decrease volume, `n` - Skip song, `m` - Mute/unmute.) while playing:

`mpg321 -K {{path/to/file_a|URL}} {{path/to/file_b|URL}} {{...}}`

- Play files randomly until interrupted:

`mpg321 -Z {{path/to/file_a|URL}} {{path/to/file_b|URL}} {{...}}`

- Shuffle the files before playing them once:

`mpg321 -z {{path/to/file_a|URL}} {{path/to/file_b|URL}} {{...}}`

- Play all files in the current directory and subdirectories, randomly (until interrupted), with Basic Keys enabled:

`mpg321 -B -Z -K .`
