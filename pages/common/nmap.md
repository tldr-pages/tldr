- Check if an IP address is up, and guess the remote host's operating system:

`nmap -O {{ip_or_hostname}}`

- Try to determine whether the specified hosts are up and what are their names:

`nmap -sn {{ip_or_hostname}} {{optional_another_address}}`

- Like above, but also run a default 1000-port TCP scan if host seems up:

`nmap {{ip_or_hostname}} {{optional_another_address}}`

- Also enable scripts, service detection, OS fingerprinting and traceroute:

`nmap -A {{address_or_addresses}}`

- Assume good network connection and speed up execution:

`nmap -T4 {{address_or_addresses}}`

- Scan a specific list of ports (use -p- for all ports 1-65535):

`nmap -p {{port1,port2,â€¦,portN}} {{address_or_addresses}}`

- Perform TCP and UDP scanning (use -sU for UDP only, -sZ for SCTP, -sO for IP):

`nmap -sSU {{address_or_addresses}}`

- Perform full port, service, version detection scan with all default NSE scripts active against a host to determine weaknesses and info:

`nmap -sC -sV {{address_or_addresses}}`
