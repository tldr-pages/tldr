# Moro

> Track work time.

- Run moro once right after you start your working day, and when you're leaving:

`moro`

- In case you need to adjust the start of your working day, for example if you forgot to run moro in the morning:

`moro hi 09:30`

- In case you need to adjust the end of your working day, for example if you forgot to run moro before you ended your working day:

`moro bye 17:30`

- To add notes, for example you like to remember how many hours you have spent on a specific task:

`moro note 3 hours on the web project called Foo`

- To see the full report of all records and notes:

`moro report --all`
