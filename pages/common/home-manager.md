`home-manager build`

- Build and apply (switch to) the new configuration:

`home-manager switch`

- Roll back to a previous configuration generation:

`home-manager rollback`

- List all existing configuration generations:

`home-manager generations`

`home-manager {{command}} --flake {{path/to/flake}}`
