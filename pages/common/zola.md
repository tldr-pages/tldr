- Create the directory structure used by Zola at the given directory:

`zola init {{my_site}}`

- Build the whole site in the `public` directory after deleting it:

`zola build`

- Build the whole site into a different directory:

`zola build --output-dir {{path/to/output_directory/}}`

- Build and serve the site using a local server (default is `127.0.0.1:1111`):

`zola serve`

- Build all pages just like the build command would, but without writing any of the results to disk:

`zola check`
