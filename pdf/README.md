## Highlights

- There are no LaTeX dependencies

- 3 available color-schemes- *Basic*, *Solarized Light* and *Solarized Dark*. More can be added easily through CSS.


## Requirements

The PDF is generated by first converting the markdown files to HTML, and then rendering those HTML files as PDF. It depends on the following libraries-

#### Python-Markdown

    pip3 install markdown
    
#### WeasyPrint

    pip3 install WeasyPrint
    
Make sure OS specific dependencies for WeasyPrint are installed by following the instructions [here](http://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## Usage

Generating the PDF is as simple as running-

    python3 render.py <path-to-directory-with-md-files> <color-scheme>
    
The first argument is mandatory, while the second argument is optional. The following color-schemes can be specified-

    solarized-light
    solarized-dark
    
If none is specified, the PDF will be rendered with the default color-scheme.

Example - `python3 /home/user/tldr/pages/linux solarized-dark`

## To-do

- [ ] Add an index page for easier navigation.

- [ ] Make first argument simpler - Just require the name of the OS, instead of path to directory.
