## Highlights

- No LaTeX dependencies for generating the PDF.
- 3 available color-schemes: *Basic*, *Solarized Light* and *Solarized Dark*. More can be added easily through CSS.

## Requirements

The PDF is generated by first converting the markdown files to HTML, and then rendering those HTML files as PDF. It depends on `markdown` and `weasyprint` libraries. To install the dependencies, run:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Make sure OS specific dependencies for WeasyPrint are installed by following the instructions [here](http://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## Usage

Generating the PDF is as simple as running

    python3 render.py <path-to-pages-directory> -c <color-scheme>

Complete information about the arguments can be viewed by running

    python3 render.py --help

The color-schemes that can be specified are

* `solarized-light`
* `solarized-dark`
