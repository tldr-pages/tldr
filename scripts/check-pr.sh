# This script is executed by GitHub Actions for every pull request opened.
# It currently accomplishes the following objectives (for English pages only):
#
#  1. Detect pages that were just copied (i.e. cp pages/{common,linux}/7z.md).
#  2. Detect pages that were added in a platform specific directory although
#     they already exist under 'common'.
#  3. Detect pages that were added in the 'common' platform although they
#     already exist under a platform specific directory.
#  4. Detect other miscellaneous anomalies in the pages folder.
#
# Results are printed to stdout, logs and errors to stderr.
#
# NOTE: must be run from the repository root directory to correctly work!
# NOTE: no `set -e`, failure of this script should not invalidate the build.
