## What is tldr-pages?

The **tldr-pages** project is a collection of community-maintained help pages
for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement
to traditional [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).

Maybe you are new to the command-line world? Or just a little rusty?
Or perhaps you can't always remember the arguments to `lsof`, or `tar`?

It certainly doesn't help that the first option explained in `man tar` is:

```
-b blocksize
   Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.
   As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading from or writing to tape drives,
   and usually not even then as the default block size of 20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.
```

There seems to be room for simpler help pages, focused on practical examples.
How about:

This repository is just that: an ever-growing collection of examples
for the most common UNIX, Linux, macOS, SunOS and Windows command-line tools.

## How do I use it?

A popular and convenient way to access these pages on your computer
is to install the [Node.js client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-node-client),
which is supported by the tldr-pages project maintainers:

    npm install -g tldr

You can also use the fully-featured [official Python client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client) which can be installed via `pip3`.

    pip3 install tldr

That way you can write `tldr tar` in the terminal to show the tldr page for `tar`,
just like you would write `man tar` to show its manpage.

However, if you just want to browse without installing anything, check
out the [PDF version](https://tldr.sh/assets/tldr-book.pdf).

There are also various other clients provided by the community,
both for the command-line and for other platforms:

## What does "tldr" mean?

TL;DR stands for "Too Long; Didn't Read".
It originates in Internet slang, where it is used to indicate that a long text
(or parts of it) has been skipped as too lengthy.
