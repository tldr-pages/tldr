<b>kill</b><br><br>
<b>Sends a signal to a process, usually related to stopping the process.</b><br><br><b>All signals except for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can be intercepted by the process to perform a clean exit.</b><br><br>
- Terminate a program using the default SIGTERM (terminate) signal:

<blockquote>kill <i>process_id</i></blockquote>
- List available signal names (to be used without the `SIG` prefix):

<blockquote>kill -l</blockquote>
- Terminate a program using the SIGHUP (hang up) signal. Many daemons will reload instead of terminating:

<blockquote>kill -<i>1|HUP</i> <i>process_id</i></blockquote>
- Terminate a program using the SIGINT (interrupt) signal. This is typically initiated by the user pressing `Ctrl + C`:

<blockquote>kill -<i>2|INT</i> <i>process_id</i></blockquote>
- Signal the operating system to immediately terminate a program (which gets no chance to capture the signal):

<blockquote>kill -<i>9|KILL</i> <i>process_id</i></blockquote>
- Signal the operating system to pause a program until a SIGCONT ("continue") signal is received:

<blockquote>kill -<i>17|STOP</i> <i>process_id</i></blockquote>
- Send a `SIGUSR1` signal to all processes with the given GID (group id):

<blockquote>kill -<i>SIGUSR1</i> -<i>group_id</i></blockquote>
