<b>diff</b><br><br>
<b>Compare files and directories.</b><br><br>
- Compare files (lists changes to turn `old_file` into `new_file`):

<blockquote>diff <i>old_file</i> <i>new_file</i></blockquote>
- Compare files, ignoring white spaces:

<blockquote>diff -w <i>old_file</i> <i>new_file</i></blockquote>
- Compare files, showing the differences side by side:

<blockquote>diff -y <i>old_file</i> <i>new_file</i></blockquote>
- Compare files, showing the differences in unified format (as used by `git diff`):

<blockquote>diff -u <i>old_file</i> <i>new_file</i></blockquote>
- Compare directories recursively (shows names for differing files/directories as well as changes made to files):

<blockquote>diff -r <i>old_directory</i> <i>new_directory</i></blockquote>
- Compare directories, only showing the names of files that differ:

<blockquote>diff -rq <i>old_directory</i> <i>new_directory</i></blockquote>
