- Authenticate the CLI client against the Vault server, using an authentication token:

<blockquote>vault auth <i>authentication-token</i></blockquote>
- Store a new secret in the vault, using the generic back-end called "secret":

<blockquote>vault write secret/<i>hello</i> value=<i>world</i></blockquote>
- Read a value from the vault, using the generic back-end called "secret":

<blockquote>vault read secret/<i>hello</i></blockquote>
