<b>git rebase</b><br><br>
<b>Reapply commits from one branch on top of another branch.</b><br><br><b>Commonly used to "move" an entire branch to another base, creating copies of the commits in the new location.</b><br><br>
- Rebase the current branch on top of the master branch:

<blockquote>git rebase <i>master</i></blockquote>
- Start an interactive rebase, which allows the commits to be reordered, omitted, combined or modified:

<blockquote>git rebase -i <i>target_base_branch_or_commit_hash</i></blockquote>
- Continue a rebase that was interrupted by a merge failure, after editing conflicting files:

<blockquote>git rebase --continue</blockquote>
- Abort a rebase in progress (e.g. if it is interrupted by a merge conflict):

<blockquote>git rebase --abort</blockquote>
- Move part of the current branch onto a new base, providing the old base to start from:

<blockquote>git rebase --onto <i>new_base</i> <i>old_base</i></blockquote>
- Reapply the last 5 commits in-place, stopping to allow them to be reordered, omitted, combined or modified:

<blockquote>git rebase -i <i>HEAD~5</i></blockquote>
