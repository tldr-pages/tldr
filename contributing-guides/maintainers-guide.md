# Maintainer's guide

The following guidelines are meant to provide a general basis
for the behavior expected of tldr-pages maintainers:

- When responding to issues or pull requests,
  remember that you're temporarily the face of the tldr-pages project.
  **Be welcoming and friendly**, and if you don't know how to answer,
  ping other maintainers who you think might have a say.

- Although push access allows committing directly to the repository,
  plase **create pull requests for all of your changes**,
  except the simplest ones (e.g. typo fixes).
  This ensures that the entire process other contributors go through
  is exposed to maintainers, who can then identify and address bottlenecks or inconveniences.
  Similarly, **avoid merging your own PRs**.

- Ideally, **every new discussion should receive a response within 24 hours**.
  You can respond yourself or ask other members to provide their thoughts/opinions.

- When merging PRs, use the strategy that produces a **clean git history** in the repository:
  Use squash if there's a single commit in the PR, or if the multiple commits are not independent changes.
  If the PR author took the time to craft individual, informative commit messages for each commit,
  use regular merge to honor that work and preserve the history of the changes.

- **Know when and how to say no**.
  Sometimes requests or contributions need to be declined, at least in their current form.
  The project has developed multiple guidelines over time to handle edge cases
  — get acquainted with them, and point them out when necessary.
  Be polite, but firm: it saves everyone's time and patience to make expectations clear early.

- Always remember to **thank every contribution**,
  even when it can't be accepted (in fact, especially then).
  Keep in mind that [every form of contribution](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors)
  (pull request, feature request, bug report, etc.)
  is a voluntary gift of time offered to the tldr project by someone who cares about it,
  so make sure not to take it for granted.
