# httpry

> A lightweight packet sniffer for displaying and logging HTTP traffic.
> It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file.
> More information: <http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/>.

- Save output to a file:

`httpry -o {{path/to/file.log}}`

- Listen on a specific interface and save output to a binary pcap format file:

`httpry {{eth0}} -b {{path/to/file.pcap}}`

- Filter output by a comma-separated list of HTTP verbs:

`httpry -m {{get|post|put|head|options|delete|trace|connect|patch}}`

- Read from an input capture file and filter by IP:

`httpry -r {{path/to/file.log}} '{{host 192.168.5.25}}'`

- Run as daemon process:

`httpry -d -o {{path/to/file.log}}`
