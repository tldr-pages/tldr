# umount

> Unlink a filesystem from its mount point, making it no longer accessible.
> A filesystem cannot be unmounted when it is busy.

- Unmount a filesystem, by passing the path to the source it is mounted from:

`umount {{path/to/device_file}}`

- Unmount a filesystem, by passing the path to the target where it is mounted:

`umount {{path/to/mounted_directory}}`

- Unmount all mounted filesystems (except the `proc` filesystem):

`umount -a`
